# -Customer-Segmentation-Using-Clustering-Python-
This project focuses on segmenting customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior using unsupervised machine learning. By applying K-Means clustering and exploratory data analysis (EDA), businesses can better understand customer needs and tailor marketing strategies.

Key Features
i.Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized features, and prepared data for clustering.<br>

ii.Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzed customer spending patterns, purchase frequency, and demographics.<br>

iii.Clustering Model: Used K-Means to segment customers into meaningful groups.<br>

iv.Visualization: Created scatter plots, cluster heatmaps, and elbow method charts to determine the optimal number of clusters.<br>

v.Actionable Insights: Identified high-value customer groups for targeted marketing.<br>

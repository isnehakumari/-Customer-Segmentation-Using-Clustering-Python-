# -Customer-Segmentation-Using-Clustering-Python-
This project focuses on segmenting customers into distinct groups based on purchasing behavior using unsupervised machine learning. By applying K-Means clustering and exploratory data analysis (EDA), businesses can better understand customer needs and tailor marketing strategies.

Key Features<br>

i.Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized features, and prepared data for clustering.<br>

ii.Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzed customer spending patterns, purchase frequency, and demographics.<br>

iii.Clustering Model: Used K-Means to segment customers into meaningful groups.<br>

iv.Visualization: Created scatter plots, cluster heatmaps, and elbow method charts to determine the optimal number of clusters.<br>

v.Actionable Insights: Identified high-value customer groups for targeted marketing.<br>

About the Dataset:-

Total Rows: 200

Total Columns: 5

No missing values detected.

i.Columns Overview:

ii.CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer

iii.Genre: Customer gender (Male/Female)

iv.Age: Age of the customer

v.Annual Income (k$): Annual income in thousands of dollars

vi.Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned based on customer spending behavior and purchasing data

Purpose:
This dataset is widely used for practicing customer segmentation. Using clustering techniques (like K-Means), customers can be grouped based on age, income, and spending patterns to help businesses target the right audience and improve marketing strategies.
